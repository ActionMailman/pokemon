				<p>Okay so I didn't actually like, make the data frame. I just made the website as a repository where you can access it. Except you can't really access it since the notebook is just static html containing information from when I was using the dataset earlier. Later I might use this as a template for a data frame that I actually sourced and scraped myself. <br> PS: The about section doesn't actually exist so don't try to go there cause it won't work.</p>
